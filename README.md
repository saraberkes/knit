# This is an app that pulls data from the Ravelry API
This app pulls data from the Ravelry API to answer the question "What should I knit?"
- It filters answers based on a series of questions / inputs the user answers / fills out, and then displays 3 random knitting pattern options based on those filters.
- It requires a user log-in to work and a personal API key (the proxy.php file that pulls this information from my personal log in is excluded from these files)
